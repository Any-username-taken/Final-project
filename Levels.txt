Explination:

Enemy Type is the type of enemy (enemy 1, enemy 2, etc) which it will pull presets from.
Meaning that the Preset can be the same value but still produce a different result. Only
accepts int()

Preset is the formation the Enemy Type will spawn in. That's it.

Seconds until next will go down by 0.1 each frame. When it reaches 0, it starts next wave.
Set to very high number to only use Enemies left

Enemies Left starts next wave when enemy count reaches or goes below it's value, regardless of
value in seconds until next (unless it has already reached 0). Set to negative to disable.

continue/wait stage end/shop
Continue goes to the next wave once either Seconds until next reaches 0 or enemies left is ===
or greater than actual number of enemies left.

Wait stage end waits until all enemies have been killed, and adds delay between next wave.
Planning on adding a level complete screen like in the scratch project. Might just make it 
frame by frame too.

Shop is one I don't know if I am actually going to add or not. Just pauses other gameplay until
shop is closed.

Remember to delete first | split and delete first \n split (idk what it is in javascript)

File reading goes as follows:

Enemy Type - Preset - seconds until next - enemies left - continue/wait stage end/shop
